## üö® Audit 1: Basic Form Issues (Beginner Level)

### The Problem Form

You've been asked to audit this contact form found on a client's website:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
    <title>Contact Form</title>
    <style>
        input { margin: 5px; }
        .red { color: red; }
        button { background: #ff6600; color: #ffaa00; }
    </style>
</head>
<body>
    <h1>Contact Us</h1>
    
    <form action="/submit" method="post">
        <div>Name: <input type="text" name="name"></div>
        <div>Email: <input type="text" name="email"></div>
        <div>Phone: <input type="text" name="phone"></div>
        
        <div>Message:</div>
        <textarea name="message"></textarea>
        
        <div>
            Gender:
            <input type="radio" name="gender" value="male"> Male
            <input type="radio" name="gender" value="female"> Female
            <input type="radio" name="gender" value="other"> Other
        </div>
        
        <input type="checkbox" name="newsletter"> Newsletter
        
        <br><br>
        <button type="submit">Send</button>
    </form>
</body>
</html>
```

### Accessibility Issues to Identify

**Your Task**: Before looking at the solutions below, examine the form and create a list of accessibility issues you can identify.

Use this checklist as a guide:

**Visual Accessibility**:
- [ ] Are there proper labels for all form controls?
- [ ] Do colors have sufficient contrast?
- [ ] Are required fields clearly indicated?
- [ ] Is the focus indicator visible and clear?

**Screen Reader Accessibility**:
- [ ] Can screen readers identify all form controls?
- [ ] Are related controls grouped appropriately?
- [ ] Are instructions and errors associated with the right controls?

**Keyboard Accessibility**:
- [ ] Can you navigate the entire form with just the keyboard?
- [ ] Is the tab order logical?
- [ ] Are all interactive elements keyboard accessible?

### Issues Found and Solutions

            if (!email.value.includes('@')) {
                document.getElementById('email-error').style.display = 'block';

### Advanced Issues to Identify

**Your Audit Task**: Analyze this form using these criteria:

**Form Structure Issues**:
- [ ] Are labels properly associated with inputs?
- [ ] Are error messages accessible to screen readers?
- [ ] Are instructions properly linked to their inputs?
- [ ] Is the form structure logical and navigable?

**Dynamic Content Issues**:
- [ ] Are dynamically shown/hidden error messages announced?
- [ ] Is the password strength indicator accessible?
- [ ] Are form state changes communicated to assistive technology?

**Semantic Issues**:
- [ ] Are required fields properly marked up?
- [ ] Is the date of birth field using the best input type?
- [ ] Are checkbox labels clickable and properly associated?

### Accessibility Testing Tools Exercise

**Task**: Use the following tools to audit the form above:

1. **Browser Developer Tools**:
   - Open Chrome/Firefox developer tools
   - Navigate to the Accessibility panel
   - Examine the accessibility tree
   - Check color contrast ratios

2. **WAVE Browser Extension**:
   - Install the WAVE extension
   - Run it on your form page
   - Document errors, alerts, and structural elements

3. **axe DevTools Extension**:
   - Install axe DevTools
   - Run accessibility scan
   - Review violations and their impact levels

4. **Keyboard Navigation Test**:
   - Navigate using only Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space
   - Document any unreachable elements
   - Test form submission with keyboard only

5. **Screen Reader Simulation**:
   - Enable ChromeVox (Chrome) or built-in screen reader
   - Navigate the form with screen reader active
   - Note confusing or missing announcements

### Improved Version Requirements

**Create an accessible version that includes**:

1. **Proper ARIA Labels and Descriptions**:
```html
<label for="email">Email Address <span aria-label="required">*</span></label>
<input type="email" 
       id="email" 
       name="email" 
       required 
       aria-describedby="email-help email-error">
<div id="email-help">We'll never share your email with anyone else.</div>
<div id="email-error" role="alert" aria-live="polite"></div>
```

2. **Accessible Error Handling**:
```html
<div id="email-error" 
     role="alert" 
     aria-live="polite" 
     class="error-message"
     style="display: none;">
    <!-- Error message inserted here -->
</div>
```

3. **Proper Input Types and Patterns**:
```html
<label for="dob">Date of Birth</label>
<input type="date" 
       id="dob" 
       name="dob" 
       max="2006-01-01" 
       aria-describedby="dob-help">
<div id="dob-help">Must be 18 or older to create account</div>
```

## üéØ Audit 3: Advanced Form Accessibility (Expert Level)

### Complex Multi-Step Form with Dynamic Content

This form represents a real-world scenario with complex interactions:

```html
<!-- Multi-step form with conditional fields, dynamic validation, and complex interactions -->
<!-- This would be provided as a complete HTML file with JavaScript -->
```

### Advanced Accessibility Challenges

**Your Expert-Level Tasks**:

1. **Dynamic Content Management**:
   - Ensure step changes are announced to screen readers
   - Manage focus appropriately when content changes
   - Provide progress indicators that work with assistive technology

2. **Complex Form Interactions**:
   - Conditional fields that appear/disappear based on selections
   - Real-time validation with accessible error announcements
   - Multi-select components with proper ARIA implementation

3. **Advanced ARIA Patterns**:
   - Implement `aria-live` regions appropriately
   - Use `aria-expanded`, `aria-controls` for collapsible sections
   - Proper `role` assignments for custom components

4. **Cross-Platform Testing**:
   - Test with multiple screen readers (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver)
   - Verify mobile accessibility with TalkBack/VoiceOver
   - Ensure compatibility across different browsers

## üõ†Ô∏è Accessibility Testing Toolkit

### Essential Tools Setup

**Browser Extensions** (Install these for comprehensive testing):
1. **WAVE Web Accessibility Evaluator**: Basic accessibility scanning
2. **axe DevTools**: Comprehensive accessibility testing
3. **Lighthouse**: Performance and accessibility audits
4. **Colour Contrast Analyser**: Color contrast testing

**Screen Readers to Test With**:
- **NVDA** (Free - Windows): Most commonly used free screen reader
- **JAWS** (Windows): Most popular commercial screen reader
- **VoiceOver** (macOS/iOS): Built-in Apple screen reader
- **TalkBack** (Android): Built-in Android screen reader
- **ChromeVox** (Chrome Extension): Good for basic testing

### Manual Testing Checklist

**Keyboard Navigation Tests**:
- [ ] Tab through entire form in logical order
- [ ] Shift+Tab moves backwards through form
- [ ] Enter/Space activates buttons and checkboxes
- [ ] Arrow keys work for radio button groups
- [ ] Escape key dismisses modal dialogs or cancels actions
- [ ] No keyboard traps (can always navigate away)

**Screen Reader Tests**:
- [ ] All form controls are announced with their labels
- [ ] Required fields are identified as required
- [ ] Error messages are announced when they appear
- [ ] Instructions and help text are read along with controls
- [ ] Form structure (fieldsets, legends) is clear
- [ ] Progress through multi-step forms is announced

**Visual/Cognitive Tests**:
- [ ] Color is not the only way information is conveyed
- [ ] Text has sufficient contrast (4.5:1 for normal, 3:1 for large)
- [ ] Focus indicators are clearly visible
- [ ] Form can be understood and completed when zoomed to 200%
- [ ] Error messages are clear and actionable
- [ ] Instructions are provided where needed

### Automated Testing Integration

**HTML Validation**:
```bash
# Use the HTML5 validator
curl -H "Content-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8" \
     --data-binary @your-form.html \
     https://validator.w3.org/nu/?out=json
```

**pa11y Command Line Tool**:
```bash
# Install pa11y for automated accessibility testing
npm install -g pa11y

# Test a form page
pa11y http://localhost:3000/your-form.html

# Test with specific WCAG level
pa11y --level WCAG2AA http://localhost:3000/your-form.html

# Export results to JSON
pa11y --reporter json http://localhost:3000/your-form.html > audit-results.json
```

Create a reusable library of accessible form components including:
- Text inputs with various validation states
- Select dropdowns (single and multi-select)
- Radio button groups
- Checkbox groups
- Date pickers
- File upload components
- Multi-step form wizard

Each component should include:
- Complete accessibility implementation
